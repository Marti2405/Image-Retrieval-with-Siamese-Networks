## Results

- The Siamese Neural Network (SNN) achieved a 10-precision of 2%.
- The SNN demonstrated an accuracy of 85.07% in classifying relevant images within a relevance score range of 0.01.
- Manual inspection revealed that between 10 and 50% of the top 10 retrieved images were relevant, while the rest exhibited similar visual features.

## Conclusion

Our exploration of using Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs) with key-point extraction for image retrieval suggests that the complexity introduced by this approach may not be justified by the achieved results. While the SNN demonstrated effectiveness in identifying relevant images, the overall performance indicates a need for simplification.

Moving forward, a more streamlined approach involving a simple SNN with convolutional layers is anticipated to yield superior results. This alternative strategy aims to capitalize on the power of convolutional layers for feature extraction while minimizing unnecessary complexities, offering a promising avenue for improved image retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
